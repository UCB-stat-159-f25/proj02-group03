## Sofia
I worked on part 2, with my code and descriptions in the `nlp-P02.ipynb` file. I worked on my 'sofia' branch and then merged my work into the 'main' GitHub repo. I also helped create the GH pages site and Binder link.

## Harish

I worked on Part 4 (EC) of Project 2, as well as looked over the files and cross-checking the requirements on the Project 2 Description to make sure our had all the deliverables and small details present. 

## Peter

I worked on Part 3 and managed some merge conflicts given different cached images in jupyter notebooks.
