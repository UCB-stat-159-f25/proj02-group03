    "- Topic evolution over time - see https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/topicsovertime/topicsovertime.html#visualization \n",
    "- Word frequency over time - does the frequency of certain words change over time\n",
    "- Semantic similarity - investigate similarity within and between presidents or time periods. For example, similarity between one presidents speeches, e.g. are all of Biden's speeches similar to each other? How similar are they to Trump's speeches? Are speeches from the 2000s more similar to each other than speeches in the 1800s? Which two presidents have the most similar speeches? See https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#vectors-similarity \n",
    "-  Named Entity Recognition - which entity types are most common in speeches? What are the most common words for each entity type - see https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#named-entities \n",
    "- Classification - can you build a classifier to detect democratic versus republican state of the union speeches from 1980-2024 - see https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/text/plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-text-plot-document-classification-20newsgroups-py "
